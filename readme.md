# ai03 PCB Tutorial Files
Created using the tutorial/guide found here:
https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide

I wouldn't recommend picking these files up and ordering PCB's - while they are correct and working to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time I've made a PCB from scratch. Consider at minimum reviewing my work.
